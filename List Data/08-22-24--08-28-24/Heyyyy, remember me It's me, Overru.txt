"Heyyyy, remember me? It's me, Overrun! Remember me from 8th and 9th edition? When we used to sprint genestealers 20 inches after cooking some poor 1w space marine's? Or in 9th, when the reaper flyrant would sail back to the safety of tyrant guard after removing a critical piece from the opponent's army? Haha, good times... Look, I know I'm not what I used to be, but all I'm asking is for another chance! I still got some juice left in the tank, surely we can break the game for a third edition? (1995 points)
